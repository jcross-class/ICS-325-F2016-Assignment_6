You will need to import the classicmodels database from mysqlsampledatabase.sql
using MySQL workbench before you start working on this assignment.

For the questions, put your SQL query first and your output second.
For example,
Question:
How many customers have a credit limit over $20,000?

Answer:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `customers` WHERE `creditLimit` > 20000;
97

1. How many customers are located in Germany? (Should return only 1 field with the count.)

2. What is the contact first name and contact last name for every contact that has a first name that starts with D?

3. What are the customer names for every company that Leslie Thompson is a sales rep for?

4. What was the amount for the last payment that Boards & Toys Co. made? (Should return only 1 field with the amount.)

5. How many payments have been made that are more than 20000? (Should return 1 field with the count.)

6. Write a PHP program that prints the following information to the terminal:
The customer name, country, and sales rep name on one line per customer.
Order the results by country first and customer name second.
See assignment_3_solution_output.txt for what the output should look like.
assignment_3.php contains most of the code you need to complete the assignment.
You will need to write the SQL query and write the output.
You should use only 1 SQL query to the database.

Problems 1 through 5 are worth 10 points each.
Problem 6 is worth 40 points.
The total number of points for the assignment is 90.

Point breakdown for problem 6:
10 points - 1 SQL query
10 points - correct output format (see assignment_3_solution_output.txt)
 5 points - correct data from the customers table
 5 points - correct data from the employees table
 5 points - order by country first
 5 points - order by customer name second
